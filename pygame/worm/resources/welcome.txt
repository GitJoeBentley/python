The Hungry Worm Game

The goal of this game is to help the worm eat apples.  Use your arrow keys to
steer the worm. You will score 10 points for each apple that the worm eats.  You 
will lose 1 point each time you bump into the wall or into a rock.  Enter a 'Q' 
to quit the game at any time.  If you quit the game, you will keep all of the 
points that you have earned (maybe it will get you into the top 10 scores).  Each 
time you eat an apple, the worm will grow and the game will speed up.  You are 
allowed only 10 collisions with the wall or a rock.  Good luck and happy eating!
